# open-data-examples
A collection of notebooks curated by the City of Cleveland demonstrating ways to interact with and analyze data from the Open Data portal

## [American Community Survey By Ward](https://github.com/City-of-Cleveland/open-data-examples/blob/main/01-ACS%20Census%20Data%20by%20City%20Ward.ipynb)
This notebook will walk you through extracting census data, dividing it by ward, and visualizing that data on a map. We use a variety of python packages, including the cle-data-toolkit, to be able to calculate disability statistics by ward. 

## [County Property Data](https://github.com/City-of-Cleveland/open-data-examples/blob/main/02-County%20Property%20Data%20-%20Corporate%20Owners%20by%20Neighborhood.ipynb)
In this example, we walk through how to fetch the county's parcel data and analyze which properties have corporate owners. The county has lots of interesting information about each individual parcel in the county, and we can show you the types of analytics that city employees are interested in.
